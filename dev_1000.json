I was just wondering how many more rainbows I should\/could stock?I also have a RTS in the tank... and I was thinking that I might also like a small school of tetras or threadfin rainbows in the mix.he rainbows that you currently have will max out at about 4-5, so you probably could add 3 to 5 more in that size range. Then if you added some threadfin (max size around 2) in a group of 8-10 would be pretty. Or, if you added some Celebes (max size around 3) then a group of 6 would be neat.","Do mother cats mate with their offspring? Yes, mother cats do mate with their offspring.
